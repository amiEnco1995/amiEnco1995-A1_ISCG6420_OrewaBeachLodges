This front-end only website was designed for the Assignment One of ISCG 6420 Web Development and Design. This is a single webpage which contains an animated banner, animated advertisment and a booking system created only with HTML, CSS and Javascript. However the fonts used are from Google fonts while the icons used are free fonts from Font Awesome. The webpage attempts to be responsive as well. In the navigation bar you will find links to the storyboards and wireframes for the main features of this website. The data submitted in the booking system are only stored in your local storage and will be cleared once you have finished the booking process.
